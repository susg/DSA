1) In a k-ary tree where every node has either 0 or k children, following property is always true.

  L = (k - 1)*I + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes
      I = Number of internal nodes  

 2) In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

   L = T + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes
      T = Number of internal nodes with two children
